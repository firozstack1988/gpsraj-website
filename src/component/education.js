assistance to underprivileged students from pre-primary level to higher level belonging 
to the low-income households to perform better in classes and exams with an aim to 
facilitate quality education and curb dropout. The guardians of the above-mentioned 
students are commonly poor and most of them are not capable enough to assist their 
children in preparing homework. As a result, their children canâ€™t prepare homework 
and classwork find studies uninteresting and shun education as well as school in the 
halfway. And this is a root cause for school dropouts.</p> </div>
